<p>A content management system (CMS) is a computer program that allows publishing, editing and modifying content as well as maintenance from a central interface.</p>
<p>Such systems of content management provide procedures to manage workflow in a collaborative environment. These procedures can be manual steps or an automated cascade.</p>
<p>CMSs have been available since the late 1990s.</p>

<p>CMSs are often used to run websites containing blogs, news, and shopping. Many corporate and marketing websites use CMSs.</p>
<p>CMSs typically aim to avoid the need for hand coding but may support it for specific elements or entire pages.</p>
